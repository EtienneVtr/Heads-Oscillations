# HeadOscillations Project

## Overview

The **HeadOscillations** project is a Unity-based application designed to simulate head oscillation movements. The goal is to reduce motion sickness in virtual reality (VR) applications by providing a realistic simulation of head movements. The project includes footstep sounds, head oscillation simulation, and provide a FMS test each 30 seconds. 

## Features

- **Head Motion Simulation**: Realistic simulation of head oscillation movements.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable settings to modify the behavior of head oscillations.
- **Sound**: Footstep sounds are played when the player moves.
- **FMS Test**: Functional Movement Screen (FMS) test is performed every 30 seconds.

## Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 or later
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of C# and Unity
