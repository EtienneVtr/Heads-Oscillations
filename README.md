## Project Overview

This project aims to create a simulation to measure the impact of head oscillations on user comfort in virtual reality environments. The simulation includes three distinct virtual environments with varying terrain types and features that allow for comprehensive testing and analysis.

## Project Structure

The project's main assets, including scenes, scripts, and animations, are located in the following directory: ``vatry-hci-project/Assets/Scenes/HeadOscillations``


## Features

- **Three Virtual Environments**: 
  - Flat terrain
  - Terrain with regular bumps
  - Terrain with noise-generated bumps

- **Head Oscillations**: Ability to activate or deactivate head oscillations during user movement.

- **Footstep's Sounds**: Integration of footstep sounds that can be activated or deactivated during oscillations.

- **Comfort tests**: Fast Motion Sickness scales appear at regular intervals to monitor user discomfort in real-time.

## Controls

The controls for the simulation are as follows:
- **Walk**: Right OR left trigger button
- **Run**: Right AND left trigger button
- **Increase slider value during test**: Right trigger button
- **Decrease slider value during test**: Left trigger button
- **Validate test**: A button
- **Activate/deactivate oscillations**: Right grip button
- **Activate/deactivate footstep sound during oscillations**: Left grip button (note: footstep sound can only be heard when oscillations are activated)

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust platform for testing and understanding the impact of head oscillations on user comfort in virtual reality. The modular design allows for easy adaptation and expansion for future research and development.
