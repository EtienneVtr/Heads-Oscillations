## Description
A VR environment can give sickness to the user. This project aims to simulate the head's oscillations in a VR environment to study the impact of the oscillations on the user's sickness.

## Features
- The user can activate or deactivate the oscillations
- We can control the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations
- There is three different environments to test the oscillations :
  - A flat ground
  - A ground with linear bumps
  - A ground with unregular bumps
